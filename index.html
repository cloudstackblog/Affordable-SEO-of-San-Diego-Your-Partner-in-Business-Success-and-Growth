                <h2>What is SEO and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.affordableseollc.com/">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</a> is the practice of improving your website’s visibility on search engine result pages (SERPs) through organic (unpaid) strategies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you show up higher on search results, the chances of users clicking on your website and learning more about what you offer increase. SEO includes a variety of tactics, from keyword research and on-page optimization to content creation and link-building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here’s why SEO matters:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Increased Visibility:</b> The higher you rank on search results, the more people will discover your business. SEO puts your website in front of users who are actively searching for your services or products.</li>
                    <li><b>Improved Credibility:</b> Search engines trust businesses that appear on the first page of results. Higher rankings not only increase traffic but also enhance your reputation and authority.</li>
                    <li><b>Cost-Effectiveness:</b> Unlike paid advertising, SEO is an ongoing investment that continues to drive results over time. Once your website is optimized, it requires less ongoing effort and offers long-term benefits.</li>
                    <li><b>Higher Conversion Rates:</b> Organic search traffic often converts better because it targets users who are already interested in your products or services, making them more likely to engage and convert. At Affordable SEO of San Diego, we use ethical, white-hat SEO strategies that align with Google’s guidelines. This ensures sustainable, long-term results that help your business grow without risking penalties from search engines.</li>
                </ul>
